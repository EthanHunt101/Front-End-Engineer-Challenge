# AISA Solution Front-End Engineer Intern Challenge - Results summary component

Thank you to the AISA Solotion developers for allowing me the chance to show off my front-end skills through this fun and in-depth challenge. I had a blast creating the inital design and an even better time tinkering with the padding, margin, text sizes, and many other things to ensure that my solution looks as close to the real version as possible.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Fetch API
- Variable Fonts

### What I learned

This was a great challenge to show off my skills and knowledge in both html and CSS. I used some properties that I had't used in quite some time, so this was a great exercise to allow myself to be reacquainted. 

### Useful resources

- [FreeCodeCamp - FetchAPI Newsletter](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-practical-es6-guide-on-how-to-perform-http-requests-using-the-fetch-api-594c3d91a547/) - I had never fetched data from a .json file before, so I used this news article to guide me through the process, so that I could tackle the data in this project on my own after.

- [CSS: Cascading Style Sheets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - A great resource that I used to refresh myself on some of the specific CSS properties.
